**This is a modified version of ZKsync ERA node with experimental support of Zk OS.**

To run the node, please run:

To run dependencies (postgres, geth):
```
zkstack containers
```

Reinstall zkstack (not always needed)
```
zkstackup --local
```

Do a regenesis:
```
zkstack ecosystem init --deploy-paymaster --deploy-erc20 \               
          --deploy-ecosystem --l1-rpc-url=http://localhost:8545 \
          --server-db-url=postgres://postgres:notsecurepassword@localhost:5432 \
          --server-db-name=zksync_server_localhost_era \
          --ignore-prerequisites --verbose \
          --observability=false 
```     

Now run the server. Note that it also runs prover input generator by default
```
zkstack server --ignore-prerequisites --chain era --zkos
```

**Edit - are they still funded?..**
On server start, the wallets listed
[here](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-era/blob/zkos-dev/core/node/zkos_state_keeper/src/keeper.rs#L188) are
funded. This list can be modified - added wallets are funded on server restart (no regenesis is needed)

# ZKsync Era: A ZK Rollup For Scaling Ethereum

[![Logo](eraLogo.png)](https://zksync.io/)

ZKsync Era is a layer 2 rollup that uses zero-knowledge proofs to scale Ethereum without compromising on security or
decentralization. Since it's EVM compatible (Solidity/Vyper), 99% of Ethereum projects can redeploy without refactoring
or re-auditing a single line of code. ZKsync Era also uses an LLVM-based compiler that will eventually let developers
write smart contracts in C++, Rust and other popular languages.

## Disclaimer

ZKsync Era has been through lots of testing and audits. Although it is live, it is still in alpha state and will go
through more audits and bug bounty programs. We would love to hear our community's thoughts and suggestions about it! It
is important to state that forking it now can potentially lead to missing important security updates, critical features,
and performance improvements.
